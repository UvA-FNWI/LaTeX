LaTeX is installed by installing a **distribution**. A distribution is a collection of packages and programs. We recommend the following distributions:

#### Windows and Linux

[TeX Live]. On Linux you can also use a package manager; e.g. in Ubuntu you can use the command `sudo apt-get install texlive`. TeX Live also contains TeXworks, the editor we will use throughout this course.

#### MacOS

[MacTeX] and [TeXworks]. This is the Mac version of TeX Live and TeXworks, which has to be installed separately on Mac.

  [TeX Live]: http://www.tug.org/texlive/
  [MacTeX]: http://www.tug.org/mactex/
  [TeXworks]: https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases

### TexWorks

After installing you need to find **TexWorks**. This is a LaTeX-editor which we will use to edit latex-files and to process them.
