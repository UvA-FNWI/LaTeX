LaTeX is installed by installing a **distribution**. A distribution is a collection of packages and programs. We recommend the following distributions:

#### Windows and Linux

[TeX Live]. On Linux you can also use a package manager; e.g. in Ubuntu you can use the command `sudo apt-get install texlive`. TeX Live also contains TeXworks, the editor we will use throughout this course.

#### MacOS

[MacTeX]. This is the Mac version of TeX Live.

  [MacTeX]: http://www.tug.org/mactex/

### TexWorks

After installing you need to find **TexWorks** (it is part of the TeXLive installation). This is a LaTeX-editor which we will use to edit latex-files and to process them.
