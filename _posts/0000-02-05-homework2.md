The exam next week consists of two parts:

1.  Typeset a given text using LaTeX.
2.  Solve a math problem and write both the problem and your solution
    down in LaTeX.

Please note the final exam *is in Dutch*. You are allowed to use the
internet during the test, but you cannot communicate with your fellow
students.

In the second exercise we will see if you are able to write down your
own proof correctly, see the [Schrijfgids]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 0000-02-01-schrijfgids %}) for guidelines. On
[Canvas](http://canvas.uva.nl) you can find the exam of 2016.
