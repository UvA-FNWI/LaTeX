Recall from the previous lesson that you write text in the `document`
environment.

Characters
----------

The characters

```
a-z A-Z 0-9 + = * / ( ) [ ]
```

and the punctuation marks

```
, ; . ? ! : ` ' -
```

and the *space*, *tab* and *enter* can be used directly in LaTeX code
for writing text.

<div class="example">
This is a handbook about TeX, a new typesetting system intended for the
creation of beautiful books and especially for books that contain a lot
of mathematics.
</div>

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\begin{document}
This is a handbook about TeX, a new typesetting system intended for the
creation of beautiful books and especially for books that contain a lot
of mathematics.
\end{document}
```

Multiple spaces, tabs and line breaks are treated as a single space in
LaTeX.

<div class="example">
This looks like a normal sentence.
</div>

```latex
This        looks    like
a normal      sentence  .
```

However, a blank line creates a new *paragraph*. We will discuss this
later.

The following characters are **reserved characters**:

```
$ % ^ & _ { } ~ \
```

This means they have a special meaning in LaTeX. We already saw how to
use `{`, `}` and `\`. If you want to use reserved characters in your
text you can use commands:

```latex
\# \$ \% \^{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash{}
```

When LaTeX encounters a `%` at a line it will ignore the rest of this
line and all whitespace at the beginning of the next line. Hence, `%`
can be used to write *comments* in your code. For example

```latex
\newcommand{\CC}{\mathbf{C}} % This command defines the field C.
```

Comments are also useful to temporarily remove a piece of text from the
output.

Accents and special characters
------------------------------

There are two ways to enter letters with accents like é, ñ and å or
special characters: using *unicode* and using commands.

### Unicode

By adding

```latex
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
```

to the preamble, many special characters will be typeset correctly when
typed directly in the LaTeX code. To type these characters one has to
use special key combinations (depending on the operating system and
system language) or by copying them from other documents.

### Commands

The second way to enter special characters is by using LaTeX commands. A
list of some of these commands is displayed below. (A more extensive
list can be found on
[wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Escaped_codes))

|---
| command | output | description |
|-------|------|-----------|
|`\'o`  |   ó  |accent aigu|
|`\^o`  |   ô  |circumflex|
|`\"o`  |   ö  |umlaut, diaeresis|
|`\~o`  |   õ  |tilde|
|`\.o`  |   ȯ  |dot|


Note that we left `{` `}` out of these commands (we type `\'e` instead
of `\'{e}`) since we don't need these brackets for commands consisting
of one non-letter.

LaTeX distinguishes three different types of dashes in text: the
**hyphen** -, the **en dash** - and the **em dash** —. These can be
inserted using `-`, `--` and `---`. Use an *en dash* to indicate a
range, for example 'rows 1–10'. Use the *em dash* to denote a break in a
sentence: 'He was running, Watson—running desperately'. In Dutch it is
common to surround the *en dash* by spaces: 'Jacqueline vertrok – zonder
nog een woord te zeggen'.

An **ellipsis** is a sequence of three dots indicating that some text is
left out. For the right spacing one can use `\ldots`.

**Quotes** are typeset with a *backtick* `` ` `` and an apostrophe `'`.

<div class="example">
'quote', "quote", "A 'quote' inside a quote"
</div>

```latex
`quote', ``quote'', ``A `quote' inside a quote''
```

<div class="panel panel-primary">
<h3 class="panel-heading panel-title"> Exercise 1 </h3>
<div class="panel-body">
1.  Typeset the following names twice: with and without using unicode.
    Hint: Erdős is Hungarian.

	<div class="example">
	Kurt Gödel, Endre Szemerédi, Muhammed al-Khowârizmi, Paul Erdős
	</div>
2. Typeset the sentence

	<div class="example">
	“A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems.” — Paul
	Erdős (1913–1996)
	</div>
</div> </div>

Paragraphs
----------

Paragraphs can be made in LaTeX by leaving a line blank. For example

<div class="example" style="text-align: justify;">
Erdős' high productivity can be seen from the fact that he published around 1500 scientific articles, most of them together with others. He worked together with about 500 collegues. thought of mathematical research as a social activity and changed the way of doing mathematics permanently.

He was engaged with number theory, combinatorics, set theory, analysis and stochastics, but made contributions to almost every subarea of mathematics.

In 1984 he won the most lucrative award in mathematics, the Wolf Prize, and used all but 720 of the USD 50,000 prize money to establish a scholarship in his parents’ memory in Israel.

```

By default, LaTeX will justify paragraphs: whitespace is adjusted to
spread the words uniformly over the line so that the paragraphs fill the
entire width of the page. LaTeX will break words if needed. Every
language has its own rules for hyphenation. The correct rules are loaded
by the `babel` package.

```latex
\usepackage[dutch]{babel}
```

### Non-breaking space

A **non-breaking space** is a space which cannot be enlarged and where a
sentence won't break. A non-breaking space (or *tie*) can be added using
`~`. One uses this mostly in references:

```latex
Chapter~12
Theorem~1.2
Bartel~Leendert van~der~Waerden
Charles~XII
From 0 to~1
```

> “Ties”—denoted by ‘~’ in plain TeX—are the key to successful line
> breaking. Once you learn how to insert them, you will have graduated
> from the ranks of ordinary TeXnical typists to the select group of
> Distinguished TeXnicians. And it’s really not difficult to train
> yourself to insert occasional ties, almost without thinking, as you
> type a manuscript. -- Donald Knuth

### The end of a sentence

LaTeX inserts more whitespace after the end of a sentence than it does
between two words. The reason is that this looks good when the text is
justified. However, this could cause problems when there is a period in
the middle of a sentence; LaTeX thinks the sentence ends and adds more
whitespace. To solve this you can use `\␣`, a backslash followed by a
space.

```latex
The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.\ are interesting.
```

If you want to prevent LaTeX from breaking the line after the period,
you can use `~` instead of `\␣`.

### Manual line-breaking

With `\-` you can manually suggest where to break a line in a word. For
example

```latex
type\-set\-ting
```

Here, the line can only be broken at places with a `\-`. This is useful
for words with special characters, since LaTeX doesn't break these
automatically. The same holds for words containing a dash. You should
only use this when a word is split incorrectly. Many words will be
hyphenated in the right way by the `babel` package.

Structure
---------

Recall that we prefer to determine the layout of our text by structuring
it with commands and environments. We will discuss a few important
examples.

### Emphasis

Words should be emphasised with the command `\emph`. Usually emphasised
text appears in italics, but this can be changed. It is considered bad
practise to use commands like `\textit`, since LaTeX code is meant for
content and not for layout.

<div class="example">This is *important*.

*This is* important.
</div>

```latex
This is \emph{important}.
\emph{This is \emph{important}.}
```

### Lists

Lists can be made using the `itemize` environment and the `enumerate`
environment.

<div class="example">
* Green
* Yellow
* Pink
</div>

```latex
\begin{itemize}
\item Green
\item Yellow
\item Pink
\end{itemize}
```

In LaTeX it is very easy to number the elements of your list.

<div class="example">
1. Green
2. Yellow
3. Pink
</div>

```latex
\begin{enumerate}
\item Green
\item Yellow
\item Pink
\end{enumerate}
```

If you want to create lists indexed by letters or Roman numerals instead
of numbers, you can load the package `enumitem`.

### Typesetting text literally

The `verbatim` environment makes sure text is typeset literally, that
is, LaTeX will ignore any commands in the text. The text also gets a
*monospaced typewriter font* so it can be used to typeset computer code:

```latex
\begin{verbatim}
def gcd(a,b):
"""
Euclides' algorithm.
"""
while a:
a, b = b%a, a
return b
\end{verbatim}
```

You can insert a code snippet inline using `\verb`.

```latex
You can set the author with \verb![](\author)!.
```

The first character after `\verb` determines where `\verb` stops. Hence
a different character from `!` works too.

### Hyperlinks

The `hyperref` package provides the command `\url` to create hyperlinks.
You can load `hyperref` using

```latex
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
```

A hyperlink can be made using

```latex
\url{http://www.ctan.org}
```

or

```latex
\href{http://www.ctan.org}{CTAN}
```

### Quotations

There are three standard environments for quotations.

`quote`
:   for one or more short quotes

`quotation`
:   for longer quotes with several paragraphs

`verse`
:   for quotes where line breaking is very important, such as songs. The
    line has to be broken manually with `\\`.

<div class="panel panel-primary">
<h3 class="panel-heading panel-title"> Exercise 2 </h3>
<div class="panel-body">
1.  Typeset the following list by using the environments `enumerate` and
    `itemize`. Don't number the lists yourself! (You don't have to reproduce the specific dots).

<div class="example">
1.  Alkali metals
	* Hydrogen
	* Lithium
	* Sodium
2.  Noble gases
	1. Fairly nonreactive
	2. Low boiling points
	3. Low densities
