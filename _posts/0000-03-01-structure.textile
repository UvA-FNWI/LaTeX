This lesson is about the structure of a LaTeX file.

h2. A LaTeX document

Every LaTeX document has the following structure:

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}

\begin{document}

\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

In this, @article@ can be replaced by a different _document class_. The part before @\begin{document}@ is called the *preamble*. 
The preamble contains commands which influence the entire document. For example, packages are loaded here. The actual text of your document is between @\begin{document}@ and @\end{document}@.

h3. Document classes

A *document class* is a collection of settings corresponding to a specific type of document. The document class is set with

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass[options]{class}
{% endhighlight %}

where @options@ is a list of options seperated by commas. Later, we will look further into this.

h3. Packages

Packages are extensions of LaTeX that add functionality. One can think of the possibility to add figures or additional commands for mathematical symbols. Modern _TeX distributions_ (see "Installing LaTeX":{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 0000-01-01-installinglatex %}) contain many packages, which can be used by putting

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[options]{packagename}
{% endhighlight %}

in the preamble, with @packagename@ the name of the package and @options@ a list of options. A package which is indispensible in Dutch documents is

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[dutch]{babel}
{% endhighlight %}

The @babel@ package with the option @dutch@ will make sure that LaTeX replaces standard titles such as _Chapter_ and _Table of contents_ by the Dutch equivalents _Hoofdstuk_ and _Inhoudsopgave_ respectively. The package also configures hyphenation so it is essential to use the right language option.

h3. Top matter

The preamble is followed by the document environment, beginning with @\begin{document}@ and ending with @\end{document}@. In the first lines of the document environment one gives information about the document itself, such as the name of the author, the title and the date. This is called _top matter_. With the command @\maketitle@ LaTeX will typeset the topmatter following the style of the document class. An example of top matter is

{% highlight latex %}
\title{A new proof of an old theorem}
\author{Jane Doe}
\maketitle
{% endhighlight %}
A date can be inserted with @\date{January 1st, 2017}@. If you don't use @\date@, LaTeX will typeset the current date. More than one author can be typeset with @\and@:

{% highlight latex %}
\author{Jane Doe \and John Doe}
{% endhighlight %}


<div class="panel panel-primary">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h3 class="panel-title">Exercise 1</h3>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
# Writing as little code as possible, create a Dutch document with title "Een bewijs van de Riemannhypothese" with yourself as the author.
# Make sure LaTeX typesets the date in Dutch and not in English.
# Ask one of the teachers to check your document.

</div></div>

<div class="panel-body">

We see that LaTeX determines the layout itself. This is an important concept in LaTeX! We determine the layout of the text by structuring it. By seperating layout and content
* We can focus on the content.
* We obtain a consistent layout.
* We (or a publisher) are able to change the layout easily.

</div></div>

h2. Structuring text

In LaTeX we have _groups_, _commands_ and _environments_ to structure our document.

h3. Groups

A *group* is a block of code surrounded by @{@ and @}@. A group indicates that the code belongs together.

h3. Commands

Examples of commands are @\documentclass@, @\usepackage@ and @\author@. A *command* comes in one of these two types:

* First a @\@ and then a name consisting only of letters. After the name a space, a number or a special character follows.
* First a @\@ and then a number or a special character.

The name of a command is case sensitive. Some commands require one or more arguments, which are written between @{@ and @}@ after the command. An argument can be optional, which is indicated by @[@ and @]@ after the command. The general syntax is:

{% highlight latex %}
\commandname[option1,option2,...]{argument1}{argument2}...
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Environments

An *environment* such as @document@ is created by two commands:

{% highlight latex %}
\begin{name}

\end{name}
{% endhighlight %}

Inside an environment one can write LaTeX code. An environment defines a group automatically.

<div class="panel panel-primary">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h3 class="panel-title">Exercise 2</h3>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

In this assignment we will define our own command.

# Create a new LaTeX file using the mathtools package and put the following in the preamble:

{% highlight latex %}
\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}
{% endhighlight %}

#2 Test your new command:

{% highlight latex %}
The real line $\R{}$.
{% endhighlight %}

#3 What happens if you remove the empty group @{}@?
# We will now create a command with an argument. Put the following in the preamble:

{% highlight latex %}
\newcommand{\Bb}[1]{\mathbb{#1}}
{% endhighlight %}

#5 Test it using this code:

{% highlight latex %}
The rationals $\Bb{Q}$.
{% endhighlight %}

#6 With @[1]@ we indicate that the command expects a single argument. We use this argument with @#1@. Try to make a command with two arguments.
