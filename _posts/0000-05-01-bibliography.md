Previously we examined the global structure of a LaTeX file and
we have learned how to add more structure to our texts by means 
of chapters, paragraphs, a table of contents, etc. The basic steps
on how to make a reference list is presented in [Week 3](http://uva-fnwi.github.io/LaTeX/week3/structure2/).

In this module we present some more details regarding the Bibliography and how to 
make a BibTex file.
