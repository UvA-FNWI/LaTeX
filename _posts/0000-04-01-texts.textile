Recall from the previous lesson that you write text in the @document@ environment.

h2. Characters

The characters

{% highlight latex %}
a-z A-Z 0-9 + = * / ( ) [ ]
{% endhighlight %}

and the punctuation marks

{% highlight latex %}
, ; . ? ! : ` ' -
{% endhighlight %}

and the _space_, _tab_ and _enter_ can be used directly in LaTeX code for writing text.

<div class="example">

This is a handbook about TeX, a new typesetting system intended for the creation of beautiful books and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics.

</div>

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\begin{document}
This is a handbook about TeX, a new typesetting system intended for the creation of beautiful books and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics.
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

Multiple spaces, tabs and line breaks are treated as a single space in LaTeX.

<div class="example">

This looks like a normal sentence.

</div>

{% highlight latex %}
This      looks like
a normal sentence.
{% endhighlight %}

However, a blank line creates a new _paragraph_. We will discuss this later.

The following characters are *reserved characters*:

{% highlight text %}
# $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \
{% endhighlight %}

This means they have a special meaning in LaTeX. We already saw how to use @{@, @}@ and @\@. If you want to use reserved characters in your text you can use commands:

{% highlight latex %}
\# \$ \% \^{} \& \_ \{ \} \~{} \textbackslash{}
{% endhighlight %}

When LaTeX encounters a @%@ at a line it will ignore the rest of this line and all whitespace at the beginning of the next line. Hence, @%@ can be used to write _comments_ in your code. For example

{% highlight latex %}
\newcommand{\CC}{\mathbf{C}} % This command defines the field C.
{% endhighlight %}

Comments are also useful to temporarily remove a piece of text from the output.

h2. Accents and special characters

There are two ways to enter letters with accents like é, ñ and å or special characters: using _unicode_ and using commands.

h3. Unicode

By adding

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
{% endhighlight %}

to the preamble, many special characters will be typeset correctly when typed directly in the LaTeX code. To type these characters one has to use special key combinations (depending on the operating system and system language) or by copying them from other documents.

h3. Commands

The second way to enter special characters is by using LaTeX commands. A list of  some of these commands is displayed below. (A more extensive list can be found on "wikibooks":https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Escaped_codes)

table(table table-condensed).
|_. command 	|_. output|_. description 			|
|@\'o@|ó	 	|accent aigu 							|
|@\^o@|ô	 	|circumflex 							|
|@\"o@|ö	 	|umlaut, diaeresis 			 			|
|@\~o@|õ	 	|tilde 									|
|@\.o@|ȯ	 	|dot							|

Note that we left @{@ @}@ out of these commands (we type @\'e@ instead of @\'{e}@) since we don't need these brackets for commands consisting of one non-letter.

LaTeX distinguishes three different types of dashes in text: the *hyphen*  ==-==, the *en dash* - and the *em dash* —. These can be inserted using @-@, @--@ and @---@. Use an _en dash_ to indicate a range, for example 'rows 1–10'. Use the _em dash_ to denote a break in a sentence: 'He was running, Watson—running desperately'. In Dutch it is common to surround the _en dash_ by spaces: 'Jacqueline vertrok – zonder nog een woord te zeggen'.

An *ellipsis* is a sequence of three dots indicating that some text is left out. For the right spacing one can use @\ldots@.

*Quotes* are typeset with a _backtick_ @`@ and an apostrophe @'@.

<div class="example">
'quote', "quote", "A 'quote' inside a quote"
</div>

{% highlight latex %}
`quote', ``quote'', ``A `quote' inside a quote''
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="example">

</div>

h2. Paragraphs

Paragraphs can be made  in LaTeX by leaving a line blank. For example

<div class="example" style="text-align: justify;">
&emsp;&emsp; Erdős' high productivity can be seen from the fact that he published around 1500 scientific articles, most of them together with others.

{% endhighlight %}

By default, LaTeX will justify paragraphs: whitespace is adjusted to spread the words uniformly over the line so that the paragraphs fill the entire width of the page. LaTeX will break words if needed. Every language has its own rules for hyphenation. The correct rules are loaded by the @babel@ package.

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[dutch]{babel}
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Non-breaking space

A *non-breaking space* is a space which cannot be enlarged and where a sentence won't break. A non-breaking space (or _tie_) can be added using @~@. One uses this mostly in references:

{% highlight latex %}
Chapter~12   
Theorem~1.2
Bartel~Leendert van~der~Waerden
Charles~XII
From 0 to~1
{% endhighlight %}

bq. “Ties”—denoted by ‘~’ in plain TeX—are the key to successful line breaking. Once you learn how to insert them, you will have graduated from the ranks of ordinary TeXnical typists to the select group of Distinguished TeXnicians. And it’s really not difficult to train yourself to insert occasional ties, almost without thinking, as you type a manuscript. -- Donald Knuth

h3. The end of a sentence

LaTeX inserts more whitespace after the end of a sentence than it does between two words. The reason is that this looks good when the text is justified. However, this could cause problems when there is a period in the middle of a sentence; LaTeX thinks the sentence ends and adds more whitespace. To solve this you can use @\␣@, a backslash followed by a space.

{% highlight latex %}
The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.\ are interesting.
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to prevent LaTeX from breaking the line after the period, you can use @~@ instead of @\␣@.

h3. Manual line-breaking

With @\-@ you can manually suggest where to break a line in a word. For example

{% highlight latex %}
type\-set\-ting
{% endhighlight %}

Here, the line can only be broken at places with a @\-@. This is useful for words with special characters, since LaTeX doesn't break these automatically. The same holds for words containing a dash. You should only use this when a word is split incorrectly. Many words will be hyphenated in the right way by the @babel@ package.

h2. Structure

Recall that we prefer to determine the layout of our text by structuring it with commands and environments. We will discuss a few important examples.

h3. Emphasis

Words should be emphasised with the command @\emph@. Usually emphasised text appears in italics, but this can be changed. It is considered bad practise to use commands like @\textit@, since LaTeX code is meant for content and not for layout.

<div class="example">
This is _important_.

_This is_ important.
</div>

{% highlight latex %}
This is \emph{important}. 

\emph{This is \emph{important}.}
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Lists

Lists can be made using the @itemize@ environment and the @enumerate@ environment.

<div class="example">
* Green
* Yellow
* Pink
</div>

{% highlight latex %}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Green
  \item Yellow
  \item Pink
\end{itemize}
{% endhighlight %}

In LaTeX it is very easy to number the elements of your list.

<div class="example">
# Green
# Yellow
# Pink
</div>

{% highlight latex %}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Green
  \item Yellow
  \item Pink
\end{enumerate}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to create lists indexed by letters or Roman numerals instead of numbers, you can load the package @enumitem@.

h3. Typesetting text literally

The @verbatim@ environment makes sure text is typeset literally, that is, LaTeX will ignore any commands in the text. The text also gets a _monospaced typewriter font_ so it can be used to typeset computer code:

{% highlight text %}
\begin{verbatim}
def gcd(a,b):
    """
    Euclides' algorithm.
    """
    while a:
    	a, b = b%a, a
    return b
\end{verbatim}
{% endhighlight %}

You can insert a code snippet inline using @\verb@.

{% highlight text %}
You can set the author with \verb!\author!.
{% endhighlight %}

The first character after @\verb@ determines where @\verb@ stops. Hence a different character from @!@ works too.

h3. Hyperlinks

The @hyperref@ package provides the command @\url@  to create hyperlinks. You can load @hyperref@ using

{% highlight latex %}
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
{% endhighlight %}

A hyperlink can be made using

{% highlight latex %}
\url{http://www.ctan.org}
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight latex %}
\href{http://www.ctan.org}{CTAN}
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Quotations

There are three standard environments for quotations.

- @quote@ := for one or more short quotes

- @quotation@ := for longer quotes with several paragraphs

- @verse@ := for quotes where line breaking is very important, such as songs. The line has to be broken manually with @\\@.
