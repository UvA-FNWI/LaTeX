The exam next week consists of two parts:
# Typeset a given text using LaTeX.
# Solve a math problem and write both the problem and your solution down in LaTeX.

Please note the final exam _is in Dutch_. You are allowed to use the internet during the test, but you cannot communicate with your fellow students.
In the second exercise we will see if you are able to write down your own proof correctly, see the "Schrijfgids":{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 0005-01-01-schrijfgids %} for guidelines. On "Blackboard":http://blackboard.uva.nl you can find the exam of 2016.
