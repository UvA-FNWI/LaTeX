LaTeX is installed by installing a *distribution*. A distribution is a collection of packages and programs. We recommend the following distributions:

h4. Windows and Linux

"TeX Live":http://www.tug.org/texlive/. On Linux you can also use a package manager; e.g. in Ubuntu you can use the command @sudo apt-get install texlive@. TeX Live also contains TeXworks, the editor we will use throughout this course.

h4. MacOS

"MacTeX":http://www.tug.org/mactex/. This is the Mac version of TeX Live.
