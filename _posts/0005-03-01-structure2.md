Previously we examined the global structure of a LaTeX file. In this
lesson we will learn how to add even more structure to our texts by
means of chapters, paragraphs, a table of contents, etc. We will also
discuss tables and figures.

Document classes
----------------

Recall that a **document class** is a collection of settings fitting a
type of document. The document class can be adjusted with using

{% highlight latex %}

\documentclass[options]{class}

{% endhighlight %}

where `options` is a list of options seperated by commas. For example,
the command

{% highlight latex %}

\documentclass[11pt,twoside,a4paper]{article}

{% endhighlight %}

starts an article with text size 11pt and the layout for twosided
printing on A4 paper.

There exist many document classes for LaTeX. **Standard document
classes** are classes which are always available. The most important
standard document classes are

  class       document type
  ----------- -------------------------------------------------------
  `article`   articles in scientific journals, short reports, notes
  `report`    longer reports with chapters, small books, theses
  `book`      books
  `beamer`    presentations

Commonly used options for these document classes are

  option                     description
  -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `10pt`, `11pt`, `12pt`     adjusts the size of the text, default is `10pt`
  `a4paper`, `letterpaper`   adjusts the paper size, default depends on your distribution
  `twoside`, `oneside`       determines whether the document is formatted for one-sided or two-sided printing

The document environment
------------------------

Last week we saw how to typeset the *topmatter* using `\author`,
`\title`, `\date` and `\maketitle`. We will now discuss more commands to
structure text in an `article`, `report` or `book`.

The following commands are used for chapters, sections and paragraphs:

table(table).

|*. command |*. level |                               |

| `\part` | -1 | (optional)|

| `\chapter` | 0 | (only in `book` and `report`)|

| `\section` | 1 | |

| `\subsection` | 2 | |

| `\subsubsection` | 3 | |

| `\paragraph` | 4 | |

| `\subparagraph` | 5 | |

The highest level in an `article` is `\section` and the highest level in
`book` and `report` is `\chapter`.

The command `\tableofcontents` creates a **table of contents**. If you
load the package `hyperref` all its elements will be clickable.

Often, articles start with a **summary**. This can be typeset with an
`abstract` environment.

Definitions and theorems
------------------------

For definitions, theorems, lemmas, etc. we use the package `amsthm`.
This package introduces three layouts: `plain`, `definition` and
`remark`. The preamble could for example contain

{% highlight latex %}

\theoremstyle{plain}

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\theoremstyle{definition}

\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}

\theoremstyle{remark}

\newtheorem{remark}{Remark}

\newtheorem{example}{Example}

{% endhighlight %}

The command `\newtheorem{name}{Header}` creates a new environment with
name `name` and header `Header`. The command `\theoremstyle` determines
the layout.

The code above creates four environments: `theorem`, `definition`,
`remark` and `example`. The three different types of theorems all get a
different layout.

<div class="example">
**Theorem 1.** *Lorem ipsum.*

**Definition 1.** Lorem ipsum.

*Remark 1.* Lorem ipsum.

*Example 1.* Lorem ipsum.

</div>
{% highlight latex %}

\begin{theorem}

Lorem ipsum.

\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}

Lorem ipsum.

\end{definition}

\begin{remark}

Lorem ipsum.

\end{remark}

\begin{example}

Lorem ipsum.

\end{example}

{% endhighlight %}

It can be seen that the environments are numbered automatically. By
default, every environment gets its own 'counter'. It is customary (and
clear) to use the same counter for all environments. You can attach a
counter to an `amsthm` environment by adding the name of the counter as
an optional argument in `\newtheorem`. In the next example, every
environment uses the counter of `theorem`.

{% highlight latex %}

\theoremstyle{plain}

\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}

\theoremstyle{definition}

\newtheorem{Definition}[theorem]{Definitie}

\theoremstyle{remark}

\newtheorem{remark}[theorem]{Remark}

\newtheorem{example}[theorem]{Example}

{% endhighlight %}

Proofs can be set in `amsthm` with the `proof` environment.

Figures and tables
------------------

Tabels can be created with the `tabular` environment.

<div class="example">
<img src="/../svg/table.svg" height="64" alt="Example of a table."/>

</div>
{% highlight latex %}

\begin{tabular}{llr}

\hline

object &height (cm) &weight (kg) \\

\hline

monkey & 50 & 20 & 3\\

nut & 1 & 20 0.10 \\

\hline

\end{tabular}

{% endhighlight %}

With the options `l`, `c` and `r` you set the number of columns and the
alignment of text in a columm. You can make a horizontal line with
`\hline`.

To add a number and caption to the table we use the `table` environment.

{% highlight latex %}

\begin{table}

\centering

\begin{tabular}{llr}

\hline

object &height (cm) &weight (kg) \\

\hline

monkey & 50 & 20 & 3\\

nut & 1 & 20 0.10 \\

\hline

\end{tabular}

\caption{Some properties of monkeys and nuts}

\label{tab:monkeynut}

\end{table}

{% endhighlight %}

We put the `tabular` environment inside a `table` environment. The
`table` environment creates a so-called **float**. This is a box for
which LaTeX determines the location on the page. LaTeX tries to put
tables and figures together such that the text is interrupted as little
as possible. We used `\label` to create a label in order to refer to
this table later on. If you want to create more professional tables you
could take a look at the [booktabs
package](http://archive.cs.uu.nl/mirror/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf).
More options can be found at
[Wikibooks/Tables](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables).

Figures can be inserted with the package `graphicx` and the command
`\includegraphics`. Supported extensions are pdf, png and jpg.

{% highlight latex %}

\includegraphics{figurename}

{% endhighlight %}

The argument of `includegraphics` is the name of the figure *without its
extension*. LaTeX will search in the folder containing the `.tex` file
for a file with the given name and a supported extension. Therefore you
should watch out for files with the same name but a different extension:
LaTeX might choose the wrong file.

There also exists a *float* for figures, the `figure` environment:

{% highlight latex %}

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{figuur}

\caption{Een figuur.}

\label{fig:voorbeeld}

\end{figure}

{% endhighlight %}

See [Wikibooks/Importing
Graphics](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Importing_Graphics) for
more options.

References
----------

Last week we saw how to refer to formulas using `\label` and `\eqref`.
In the same way we can refer to chapters, section, theorems,
definitions, etc. For example we can refer to a `\section`:

{% highlight latex %}

\section{Derivative}

\label{sec:derivative}

\section{Primitive}

In section \ref{sec:derivative} we saw the definition of a derivative.

{% endhighlight %}

For `\part`, `\chapter`, etc. referencing works in the same way. For
theorem environments you should put the label directly after
`\begin{theorem}`. For floats like `figure` and `table` the label should
be put *after the caption*.

You have to compile twice for the right reference to appear. The first
time you typeset your text, question marks will appear.

The advantage of referencing this way over referencing by hand is that
the number will always be correct, even after you insert more text or
change the order of the figures.

Bibliography
------------

A bibliography can be created in the following way:

{% highlight latex %}

\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}

We refer to Lamport \cite{lamport94}.

\begin{thebibliography}{x}

\bibitem{lamport94}

Leslie Lamport,

\emph{\LaTeX: A Document Preparation System}.

Addison Wesley, Massachusetts,

2nd Edition,

1994.

\end{thebibliography}

\end{document}

{% endhighlight %}

The bibliography is put in the `thebibliography` environment. The
argument `x` indicates that the counter for citations will consist of
one character. You can use `xx` for up to 99 citations. A citation is
inside a `\bibitem`. The first group after that is the label. We refer
to the source with `\cite` plus the label of the citations.

We don't recommand this way of citing for texts with many citations. You
could use **bibtex**, see [Wikibooks/Bibliography
Management](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management).
However, some publishers (e.g. Nature) don't accept `bibtex` files.
